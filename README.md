👋 Hi, I’m Bereket Desalegn

👀 I’m interested in building innovative tech solutions.

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development, focusing on JavaScript.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, web applications, and tech initiatives that make an impact.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I can't say, "I once spent hours debugging my code, only to realize I had forgotten a semicolon." TypeScript, why do you do this to me? 🤦‍♂️😂
